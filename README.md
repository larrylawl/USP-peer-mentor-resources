## Academic
1. Box links
2. Study plan / Admin resources
3. Module Workload Estimate(?)
    1. **What.** Similar to this [estimate](https://larrylawl.github.io/articles/estimate-uni-workload.html) I wrote for my mentees. 
  Benchmark for estimates can be modules every computing student would have taken (CS1231, MA1101R, MA1521, ST2334) etc.
    2. **Why.** Allows any computing student (not just freshies) to have a better estimate of their workload.
    3. **Improvements.** We can even have another column that mentions the rating of the module. Similar to the good soc mods I have compiled [here](https://github.com/larrylawl/good-soc-mods_
  
## Advice from Seniors (similar to the section in notes to future CS freshman)
  
## Side Thoughts
1. I think it'd be good to share this repo with USComputing to ask for PRs: I'm sure there are people in there
who knows more than me and are more than willing to contribute/correct information :)
2. I'm not sure if we should include advice sections as it'd become political. This being said, if we can manage to have a consensus on this advice,
it'd be really useful (such as the notes to future CS freshman).
